# Projectile Motion

This project is developed in the Processing language and is designed to demonstrate 2D projectile motion. It provides a visual and interactive way to explore the dynamics of objects launched with an initial velocity, taking into account the effects of gravity on their trajectory.

## Features

- **Visualization of 2D Projectile Motion:** See the path of the projectile in real-time as it moves through its trajectory.
- **Maximum Height Calculation:** The program calculates and displays the maximum height reached by the projectile during its motion.
- **Range of Motion:** It also calculates and shows the total horizontal distance covered by the projectile, also known as the range of motion.
- **Angle of Launch:** Users can input or adjust the angle of launch to see how it affects the trajectory, maximum height, and range of the projectile.

## How to Use

1. **Install Processing:** Make sure you have Processing installed on your computer. You can download it from [the Processing website](https://processing.org/download/).
2. **Open the Project:** Open the project file in Processing.
3. **Run the Simulation:** Press the 'Run' button to start the simulation. You will see the projectile's trajectory based on the default settings.
4. **Launch the projectile:** Click anywhere to launch your very first projectile of the simulation.
